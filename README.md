# Classify Applauses

Classify applauses and cheering apart from classical music.

The model trained here would be embedded in a client side application which filters applauses at runtime.

# Installation 

Use Anaconda.

```
$ conda install tensorflow-gpu 
```

Then run the Jupyter notebooks.

The Keras model is saved in `model`.
